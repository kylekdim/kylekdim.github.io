	<p>This part of the page will answer questions 2, 3, and 6 on the ICE1 Instruction sheet:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Question 2: I noticed that when I open my web page in Safari and Firefox, the DOB field is a free-form text field. In Chrome, the DOB field has a calendar that allows you to select a specific day.</li>
			<li>Question 3: When I click the text next to each element, the field for "DOB" is put into focus, but the same does not happen for "Name." This matters because we want to ensure that each prompt is tied to the field that the response is expected to be entered into. I have updated my code to get my form to behave as expected.</li>
			<li>Question 6: I have hosted my page on Github.</li>
		</ul>
